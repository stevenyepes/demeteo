//! Merge executor port (Phase R6).
//!
//! Wraps the existing [`crate::adapters::worktree::git_ops::GitOpsHelper`]
//! `merge_subtask` call with structured conflict detection and a
//! typed result. Implementations record the outcome in the
//! `subtask_merges` table so the audit trail survives step teardown.
